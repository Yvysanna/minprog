# Search
This is my Google Search front-end replica design. It's been my first introduction in building web-applications. The replica includes three pages: Google Search, Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search. It is built with HTML and CSS. For the Google Advanced Search page Bootstraps grid system has been used.


## Getting Started
Open index.html page to get started. You can navigate through the three pages by clicking the links in the upper-right corner or type in queries the seach bars.

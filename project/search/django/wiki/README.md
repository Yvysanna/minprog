# Wiki

This is my implementation of a dynamic Wiki encyclopedia. It's built using Django as framework and includes Python, HTML and CSS. It's an assignment for the Minor Programming at the UvA.

## Getting Started

When running the server, you'll start at index.html. Clicking the titles will get you to the different pages. If you look for a page that doesn't exist you'll be presented with an error. You can create a page by clicking New Page in the sidebar, n.b. you can't create a page if the title already exists. To edit a page go to a page and click the edit button. To save your changes click save. Clicking random pages gives you a random page.
Have fun!

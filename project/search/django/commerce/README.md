# Commerce

This is my implementation of an auction websitee. It's built using Django as framework and includes Python, HTML and CSS. It's an assignment for the Minor Programming at the UvA.


## Getting Started
When running the server, you'll start at index.html. Clicking the titles will get you to the different pages. You can create a listing by clicking Create Page in the navigation bar. For a listing you can place bids, add comments. You can also add listings to your personal watchlist. Have fun shopping!
